# Editor

This is a simple text/code editor coded in Java. For commit sequence is possible to understand how was the development.
After initial commit due to GitHub, the interface was developed using the WindowBuilder Pro GUI Desin=gner from Eclipse.
The panel and text area, menus and menu items. I Tried use other colors, but te standard colors were very well-choosen.
I choose the Courier Font like a standard for the editor, but this can change. I made a translation for English, but the
FileChooser interface was in Portuguese. It's hard to edit, because the slang depends of the idiom choosen in the Linux
install.
